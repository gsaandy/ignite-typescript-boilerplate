/* ***********************************************************
* A short word on how to use this automagically generated file.
* We're often asked in the ignite gitter channel how to connect
* to a to a third party api, so we thought we'd demonstrate - but
* you should know you can use sagas for other flow control too.
*
* Other points:
*  - You'll need to add this saga to sagas/index.ts
*  - This template uses the api declared in sagas/index.ts, so
*    you'll need to define a constant in that file.
